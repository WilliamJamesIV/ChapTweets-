William James Chaptweets
Chaptweets is a twitter api specifically made for chapman students.
So far I have allowed the user to search for a word and perform a sentiment analysis.
Also I have implemented a mode that will print out information about a tweet.
I have struggled with making the information that json puts on and making it look nice to the user. I hope to fix this soon.
I plan to implement more of the menu features, and hopefully have them printing out the information better.

I have made the JSON information printing a little bit nicer, but am struggling with getting it the way I want.
I am also having problems with the tabs in python.

I have figured out how to create and input information to a csv file.
I plan to put the info from my JSON dumps into this csv and print out. Once that works we want to be able to email the csv file out.
